# BlackJack
A blackjack program I made to practice some concepts learned in first semester 

I made this since I am interested in the game of blackjack and it seemed to be an excellent building point
for concepts like arrays and OOP.  There are a few improvements I will add in time such as high/low aces and perhaps a better way
to implement suits and make cards unique.
